2016-09-26: Intersecting Spheres
=====================================================================
Not working. Try to debug it. what it does: 
- When render is pressed App calls  m_rayTracer-> setPrimitives(m_fixedPrimitives); Which sets the RayTracer::m_spheresOn;
- if m_spheresOn is set, TraceImage constructs an array of spheres (right now containing just one sephere at (width/2, height/2, -3), with radius 0.1.
- if m_spheresOn is set, intersects() calls intersectSphere() for each sphere in the array, passing in the distance t_s to be comupted.
- t_s is then compared to t_t (for triangle intersection), if t_s is smaller the sufel for the sphere is constructed and returned.
- The position X of the surfel is at the origin of the ray translated t_s units in the direcition of the ray. 
- The normal of the surfel is the direction of the vector (X-C) where, C is the center of the sphere. 
- Bugs may be in how we determine the surfel's position and normal and or in how we compute intersection. 
- Debug it

2016-09-22: Time Log
=====================================================================
Lab section -> 3h. 
Accomplished: RayTracer class header and compiler outline

2016-09-23 -> start 15:55; end 18:25
Accomplished: 
    Basic black/white Radiance example from Ray Casting in the Graphics codex using built in intersection functions. This gave us a better understanding of how the program will work. 
    Current plan: come in tomorrow with with clear function designs, implement them, and test. 

2016-09-24 -> [16:00, 19:00], [20:00, 23:00]
Accomplished: 
    Triangle Intersection MVP, shading MVP. 

2016-09-25 -> [12:30, 18:30]
Acccomplished: 
    IndirectRays, restructred L_i, L_o. 


2016-09-22: Algorithms
=====================================================================
ncident light L-i function to call the outgoing light L_o function for each pixel in the image. Both return the radiance value to be assigned to that pixel. L_o performs 

 \begin{equation} \Lo(X, \wo) = \beta(X, Y) \cdot f_X(\wi, \wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| \end{equation}

for each light, and returns this value for a surfel only if it's visible from the light.

Indirect Light:
\begin{equation}
L_\mathrm{reflected~indirect}(X, \wo) = \int_{\mathbf{S}^2_+} \Li^1(X, \wi) \cdot f_X(\wi,\wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| ~ d\wi
\label{eqn:indirect}
\end{equation}

, recursing once on L_i. 


2016-09-22: Implementation
=====================================================================
- Image plane: 2-D array of pixels. 

2016-09-21: Advice
=====================================================================
- Work evenly divided in 4 parts:
    1. GUI;
    2. Ray tracing loop and post-processing the image;
    3. The actual ray tracing; 
    4. the ray-primitive intersection routines.

- Ray tracing algorithm takes only a few lines to implement. Design it well

- Allocate time evenly across the 4 parts, and budget debugging, svn, documentation, and final report time

- It takes a long time to render images:
    1. Debug using small images and simple scenes;
    2. Anticipate rendering time and plan ahead.

- Main bugs encountered: poorly chosen epsilon values, missing negations on directions. Break points and assertions to question my assumptions about the code. 

2016-09-21: Procedures and helpers
======================================================================
1. GUI setup
    - GApp::drawMessage to show the Rendering message. 
    - G3D::Stopwatch for computing rendering time. 
    - (helper) Fetching the resolution from GUI: Vector2int32 App::resolution() const, using G3D::TextInput to parse the selected value in the G3D::GuiDropDownList

2. Render setup
    App::onRender callback function to: 
    - Determine the rendering options; 
    - Create the output G3D::Image; 
    - Pose the scene (with GApp::onPose) to extract the G3D::Surfaces (ignored the Surface2Ds produced); 
    - Create an instace of RayTracer and set the scene from GApp::scene;
    - Launch rendering on RayTracer eith the image and GApp::activeCamera, using G3D::Stopwatch for timing;
    - Convert the image to a G3D::Texture and post-process the image with G3D::Film;
    - Display image on screen.

    Look into the post-processing code from the cpuRealTimeRayTrace project

3. Ray generation 
    - Ray inersection and ray tracing algorithms into a RayTracer class. RayTracer separates setting the scene from the actual rendering, and contains a large number of small helper routines.
    - Core internal data structures was a G2D::TriTree, used as an array via operator[] overload. 
    - G3D::Scene::onPose and G3D::TriTree::setcontents. Extract all lights from the scene into an array.
    - RayTracer::Options class abstraction (adding fixed primitives, multithreading, etc.)

    Single threaded ray tracer example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    for (Point2int32 point; point.y < height; ++point.y) {
        for (point.x = 0; point.x < width; ++point.x) {
    	    ...
        }
    }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    nice properties: the iteration variable is a 2D point ready for use in the body. loop iterates most tightly along the horizontal axis, which is how images are usually stored on the GPU. This gives good cache coherence and grouping tightly in space (in either x or y) gices good branch coherence.

    Multithreaded ray tracer example: Thread::runConcurrently to launcha 2D block:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    Thread::runConcurrently(Point2int32(0, 0), Point2int32(image->width(), image->height()), ...);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    more efficient than explicitly creating individual threads because runConcurrently optimizes for memory locality and performs load-balancing across processors. You'll need a std::function for the ... portion. I used a C++ lambda expression.

4. Intersection
    - First implemnent sphere primitive intersection, and then once working, implement triangles. 
    - If an intersection exists, construct a surfel and return it to the **shading portion** of the algorithm
    - Need to set the geometricNormal and shadingNormal to the same value: the normal to the sphere at the intersection point, and to set the position of the intersection. (ignore other properties).
    - Keep current-closest intersection distant and surfel vaules, updated when a closer intersection to the camera is found. 
    - G3D::TriTree ->  rray of triangle indices and materials. stores a binary tree internally. TriTree also stores a vertex position array to complete the indexed-triangle mesh data structure.
    - Sampling from intersection: G3D::TriTree:sample is the simplest if a TriTree::Hit is constructed for the closest intersection.
    - If the dot product of the ray direction and the counter-clockwise normal is positive, then the ray actually struck the triangle from behind. Set the G3D::TriTree::Hit::backface flag to true in this case. That tells G3D::TriTree::sample to flip the normal direction to be the one facing the ray when sampling materials and geometry for shading.
    - Alpha testing: once you've sampled a triangle, check the coverage value in the surfel. If it is less than 1.0, ignore the intersection and allow the ray to continue.

5. Precision issues
    - Ray::minDistance for bumping the ray away from the origin. For indirect light rays at glancing angles (**`line-of-sight`** helper), it is often necessary to push the ray not just out from the origin point but specifically away from the surface.
    - The normal is the known direction away from the surface, so shifting ray origins by a small epsilon times the (geometric) surface normal is a common practice. The G3D::Ray::bumpedRay can do this for you.

6. Shading
    - ~20 lines of code, mostly branches and loops
    - use [`G3D::Surfel::finiteScatteringDensity`](http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_surfel.html#aa0fb097d5a3527a00411940efb7e67b9) to evaluate $ f_X(\wi, \wo) $, and [`G3D::Light::biradiance`](http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_light.html#ac4d2f32e4082e7a4980bc05bb52f18d0) to compute the _unshadowed_ biradiance $ \beta(X, y) $.
    - trick for finding the direction from finite point $X$ to potentially-infinite homogeneous point $Y$:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
      const Vector3& omega = (Y.xyz() - X * Y.w).direction();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    -  in the mathematical notation of rendering, all vectors point _away_ from the point being shaded. You'll often have to negate ray directions and such to maintain consistency with the typeset mathematics.
    - To compute outgoing radiance from the "ambient" incoming constant, use:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
         L_o += surfel->reflectivity(Random::threadCommon()) * 0.05f;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - Render image first without shading, with radiance being equal to the surfel's lambertianReflectivity, then compute direct lightning, then shadows, then indirect lightning, which should take 3 lines
