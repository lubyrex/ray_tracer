Number of vertices= 2n. Number of faces = 3n-4. n = number of sides of top polygon. Top/bottom faces are triangular, side faces quadrilateral.

Heightfield:
    x and z coordinates correspond to width and height values, scaled by the GUI specification. Accomplished through nested for loops. number of Vertices = $Image->height*Image->width$ number of faces = $(Image->height-1)*(Image->width-1)$

Results

    ![]()

2. G3D Cornell Box:

    ![]()

3. Analytic spheres + triangles:

    ![]()

4. 2048 G3D Cornell Box:

    ![]()

5. G3D Sponza (Report rendering time):

6. Custom Scene:

Running time analysis
=======================================================
1. Number of cores (1 vs [G3D::System::numCores](http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_system.html#a4acba57a7c4353b59622dd6225f8e509))

2. Number of triangels (use heightfield to vary the number of triangles)

3. Number of pixels

4. Number of lights

5. Number of indirect rays 


Asymptotic bound
=======================================================

Questions
=======================================================
1. How would you derive an analytic intersection algorithm for a finite right cylinder? Do not actually do so.

2. How would compute the intersection with a surface for which there was no analytic intersection solution. For example, an arbitrary continuous height function y(x,z)y(x,z). Sketch an algorithm, but do not attempt to refine it.

3. How do you think a binary tree could be leveraged to accelerate the ray intersection process? If you choose to research this (not required) before answering, be sure to cite the resources that you consult.

The project took me 9.14h of required work, and 0.5 hours of additional work.
