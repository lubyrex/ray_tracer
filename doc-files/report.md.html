Rendering Algorithms
=======================================================
We defined the incident light L-i function to call the outgoing light L_o function for each pixel in the image. Both return the radiance value to be assigned to that pixel. L_o performs 

 \begin{equation} \Lo(X, \wo) = \beta(X, Y) \cdot f_X(\wi, \wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| \end{equation}

for each light, and returns this value for a surfel only if it's visible from the light. Realizing that if the object is not visible form a light, there's a shadow over it, was one of our gotcha moments. L_o also calls doIndirectLight, which picks a random direction and performs 

\begin{equation}
L_\mathrm{reflected~indirect}(X, \wo) = \int_{\mathbf{S}^2_+} \Li^1(X, \wi) \cdot f_X(\wi,\wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| ~ d\wi
\label{eqn:indirect}
\end{equation}

, recursing once on L_i. 

Our triangle and sphere intersection functions determine whether or not a surfel should be created, and at which position, for a given ray by transcribing the equations defined in the Ray Casting chapter.

Running time analysis
=======================================================
Measure and graph the running time of the program with respect to the following, ensuring other parameters are sufficiently large to ensure low variance.
1. Number of cores (1 vs 4)

![Cores x Running Time](Cores.png)

2. Number of triangles (use heightfield to vary the number of triangles)

3. Number of pixels

    ![Pixels x Running Time](Pixels.png)

4. Number of lights

5. Number of indirect rays 


Asymptotic bound
=======================================================
Number of cores: C
Number of triangles: T
Number of pixels: P
Number of lights: L
Number of indirect rays: I
Run time:O(IxLxPxT)/C

This is a bad estiamate for cores, since we know that the cores does not run tasks with multithreads perfectly efficiently, and it varies depending on the different tasks.
The estimate should be fairly accurate for other variables. Even if our codes are inefficient, it is only going to change the time by a constant factor, it hardly ever affect the run time more than that. However, with higher amount of work, the processors should perform differently, which will vary the run time.


Questions
=======================================================
1. First we need to know the center of the bottom side C, the height h, and the normal vector from the bottom side n of the cylinder. Then we construct equations of the infinite cylinder and the two infinite planes that makes up the finite cylinder. Afterwards we check whether `P+tw` intersects the infinite cylinder and planes, after that, we check whether the intersections are actually on the finite cylinder. 

2.Let X(a,b,c) be a point, then the equation for the plane would be b=y(a,b). Let P=(d,e,f),w=(g,h,i), then P+tw = (d+tg,e+th,f+ti). Therefore we can construct a function y(d+tg,f+ti)=e+th and calculate the t value.

3.We can recursively divide the space into two seperate spaces using a plane, ignoring every mesh that is intersected by the plane. Then we can find a mesh that the ray hit, then we recursively obtain all the parent meshes and get the planes that are used to seperate them. If the ray hits the mesh first then hit the plane, we can completely ignore the other side of the plane and discard that side of the binary tree, which would save us a lot of time.

Self-evaluation
=======================================================
B+

coding style: We tried to make as few copy assignements as possible, and passed all big parameters as constant references. Although we panicked at the onset of lab, which resulted in a messy first draft of working code, we managed to review and abstract our functions in a way that made more sense. 

workflow: It was definitely not the best. At first, we were confused about how to approach this project. We panicked and tried a series of different approaches, until we decided to transcribe the textbook. This set us back greatly. Pair programming was also somewhat challenging because we had to conciliate different ways of debugging, while at the same time trying to communicate clearly. 

report: Our report reflects our results to the best of our ability, and was thought through and reviewed 


Skills Learned
=======================================================
Software: We are now much more familiar with using pointers, the member functions of a class and lambda functions. We are also getting better at reading documentations of G3D engine, and in using the SVN. 

Algorithm: This project has tauhgt us how to better think about abstracting and defining functions. 

Math: the project provided a review of vector operations including dot product, cross product, vector movements. It also taught us to think about light and rays from a geometric perspective, and how to adapt mathematical perfection to imperfect code. 

Workflow
=======================================================
12h mc13+yc2 -> triangle intersection MVP, preliminary shading (almost MVP)

6h mc13+yc2 -> restructured shading, indirectRays(mc13) + GUI Draft (by yc2 - untied to App)

8h mc13+yc2 -> tie renderer and GUI (mc13), fix some renderer inconsistencies (mc13), draw analytic spheres (yc2), run tests, get report to MVP.
