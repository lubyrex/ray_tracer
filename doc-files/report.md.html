Rendering Algorithms
=======================================================
- Important Design decisions: 
- Observations:
- "Gotchas":

The reflected radiance at $X$ due to a single, unshadowed point light at $Y$ is given by:

 \begin{equation} \Lo(X, \wo) = \beta(X, Y) \cdot f_X(\wi, \wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| \end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the biradiance function of the light, $f_X$ is the bidirectional scattering
distribution function of the surface at $X$, $\wi$ is the unit vector from $X$ towards $Y$, $\wo$
is the outgoing direction, and $\n$ is the normal to the surface at $X$.

The indirect radiance term is one more iteration of the rendering equation's integral equation
(for nontransmissive surfaces). The total indirect contribution from one indirect scattering
event is therefore:

\begin{equation}
L_\mathrm{reflected~indirect}(X, \wo) = \int_{\mathbf{S}^2_+} \Li^1(X, \wi) \cdot f_X(\wi,\wo) \cdot |\wi \cdot \n| ~ d\wi
\label{eqn:indirect}
\end{equation}

where $\Li^1$ is the "one bounce" (i.e., nonrecursive) incident light function.

Running time analysis
=======================================================
Measure and graph the running time of the program with respect to the following, ensuring other parameters are sufficiently large to ensure low variance.
1. Number of cores (1 vs [G3D::System::numCores](http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_system.html#a4acba57a7c4353b59622dd6225f8e509))

2. Number of triangles (use heightfield to vary the number of triangles)

3. Number of pixels

4. Number of lights

5. Number of indirect rays 


Asymptotic bound
=======================================================

Questions
=======================================================
1. How would you derive an analytic intersection algorithm for a finite right cylinder? Do not actually do so.

2. How would compute the intersection with a surface for which there was no analytic intersection solution. For example, an arbitrary continuous height function y(x,z)y(x,z). Sketch an algorithm, but do not attempt to refine it.

3. How do you think a binary tree could be leveraged to accelerate the ray intersection process? If you choose to research this (not required) before answering, be sure to cite the resources that you consult.
